# Churn_classification_problem
In this notebook I will solve a classification problem problem with python. It is a simple task from the Master's Degree that I have coursed, so the data to solve the 
problem is assigned. Moreover, this data is completely synthetic, meaning it has been manually generated, and this will have some effects which we highlight during the analysis.

The notebook is organised in different "chapters" such as Data cleaning, EDA, evaluating some ML algorithms, feature engineering, hiperparameter tunning, predictions and so on.

Any comments, corrections or help is welcomed
